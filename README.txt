Extremely Broken Axolotl Platformer Game

So what happens when a programmer who's sick and some cool art people try and make a platformer for a hackathon while also getting a decent amount of sleep? Well, here it is. Pygame was used to initialize the sound. Tkinter was used for the rougher graphics, while character design and the ending page were hand drawn by the artist. One challenge was  getting the collision to work properly, and since the maps were hardcoded (bad idea), the collisions needed to be too. It didn't work well. One could say that it didn't work at all. 

Need to install: Pygame, Tkinter, cmu_112_graphics

Controls:
Arrow keys - Move
Space bar - Dash forward
X and Z - Fire
R - Restart
